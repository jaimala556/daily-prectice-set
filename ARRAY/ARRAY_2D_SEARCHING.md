# Array 2D matrix Searching

**Problem**: Given a 2D matrix where each row is sorted in ascending order, write a function to search for a specific element.

**Input**:

```
Matrix A = [[1, 3, 5], [7, 9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]
Target = 9
```

**Output**:

```
Element found at (1, 1)
```

---

**Problem**: Search for an element that is not present in a sorted 2D matrix. Return -1 if the element is not found.

**Input**:

```
Matrix A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
Target = 10
```

**Output**:

```
Element not found. Return -1.
```

---

**Problem**: Find the largest element in a matrix where both rows and columns are sorted in ascending order.

**Input**:

```
Matrix A = [[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60], [70, 80, 90]]
```

**Output**:

```
Largest Element = 90
```

---

**Problem**: Find the smallest element in a matrix where both rows and columns are sorted in ascending order.

**Input**:

```
Matrix A = [[5, 10, 15], [20, 25, 30], [35, 40, 45]]
```

**Output**:

```
Smallest Element = 5
```

---

**Problem**: Search for a specific element in a sorted matrix and count how many times it appears.

**Input**:

```
Matrix A = [[1, 2, 2], [3, 3, 4], [5, 6, 6]]
Target = 3
```

**Output**:

```
Element 3 appears 2 times.
```

**Problem**: Search for a specific element in a matrix where rows and columns are sorted in ascending order.

**Input**:

```
Matrix A = [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
Target = 5
```

**Output**:

```
Element found at (1, 1)
```

---

**Problem**: Use binary search to find a specific element in a row-wise sorted 2D matrix.

**Input**:

```
Matrix A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
Target = 6
```

**Output**:

```
Element found at (1, 2)
```

---

**Problem**: Find the middle element in a sorted matrix (row-wise and column-wise sorted).

**Input**:

```
Matrix A = [[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60], [70, 80, 90]]
```

**Output**:

```
Middle Element = 50
```

---

**Problem**: Find the row with the maximum sum in a row-wise sorted matrix.

**Input**:

```
Matrix A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```

**Output**:

```
Row with maximum sum = [7, 8, 9]
```

---

**Problem**: In a sorted matrix, find the first and last occurrence of a repeated element.

**Input**:

```
Matrix A = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]
Target = 3
```

**Output**:

```
First occurrence at (0, 2)
Last occurrence at (1, 1)
```
